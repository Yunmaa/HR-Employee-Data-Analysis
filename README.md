This project is an analysis of HR employee data that answers several questions related to the gender and age distribution, race and ethnicity, location, job titles, turnover rate, and tenure of employees in the company.

## Data Source
HR Data with over 22,000 rows from the year 2000 to 2020 was downloaded as a CSV file and imported into MySQL Workbench for cleaning and analysis. The final cleaned dataset is included in the project.

## SQL Queries
To answer the questions posed in this project, several SQL queries were written and executed. The queries selected subsets of the data based on different conditions and grouped the data to produce counts and averages.

## Power BI Visualization
The data analyzed using SQL queries was then visualized using Power BI. Two files are included in this project, a pbix file, and a PDF file. The pbix file is an editable Power BI file, while the PDF file is a static version of the same dashboard.

The visualization provides a graphical representation of the data and helps to illustrate the insights gained from the data analysis.

## Questions Answered
The questions answered in this project include:

1. What is the gender breakdown of employees in the company?
2. What is the race/ethnicity breakdown of employees in the company?
3. What is the age distribution of employees in the company?
4. How many employees work at headquarters versus remote locations?
5. What is the average length of employment for employees who have been terminated?
6. How does the gender distribution vary across departments?
7. What is the distribution of job titles across the company?
8. Which department has the highest turnover rate?
9. What is the distribution of employees across locations by state?
10. How has the company's employee count changed over time based on hire and term dates?
11. What is the tenure distribution for each department?


## Insights Gained:

- Gender and race/ethnicity distribution: The gender distribution in the company shows that the majority of employees are male, while the race/ethnicity distribution shows that the majority of employees are White.

- Age distribution: The age distribution of employees shows that the company has a relatively young workforce, with the majority of employees falling within the age range of 25-34.

- Location distribution: The majority of employees work at the company headquarters, while a smaller percentage work at remote locations.

- Length of employment: The average length of employment for employees who have been terminated is approximately 7 years.

- Gender distribution by department: With the exception of the R&D and Marketing departments, all departments have a higher proportion of male employees, with some departments having a significantly higher number of male employees than females.

- Job title distribution: The job title distribution shows that the majority of employees have job titles in either the R&D or Business Development departments.

- Turnover rate: The department with the highest turnover rate is the Auditing department.

- Employee count over time: The company's employee count has increased steadily over time, with some fluctuations due to changes in hiring and termination rates.

Overall, these insights can be useful for making informed decisions regarding recruitment, retention, and employee engagement strategies.

## Conclusion
This project provides insights into various aspects of employee data for a company, including demographics, location, job titles, and tenure. The analysis of the data using SQL queries and visualization using Power BI helps to provide a clear understanding of the data and its implications.
